# Scrumbugs Help
***

## Terms
### Teams
Teams aggregage tasks across projects and every project in scrumbugs belongs to a team. Example teams are Web Productions
and SUMO

### Projects
Projects are the things teams work on. These will often correspond to products in bugzilla. Example projects are Mozilla.org
and Affiliates.

### Backlog
The backlog is a list of bugs from bugzilla. These are defined per project by specifing a product and component. Scrumbugs
will suck in all bugs within that product component that have U C P tags. We assume if U C P tags are filled out, the task
is ready enough to go into a backlog

### Ready List
The ready list is a list of bugs that are ready to be worked on, this is a subset of the backlog and defines work that
should be worked on if a developer is available.

### Sprint
A defined period of time where work is assigned

***
## Getting Started

### Creating a Team
If you are new to scrumbugs you will need to create a team. To do this navigate to the team page and click create.

### Creating Projects
To create a new project, navigate to projects and create new. You will need to specify the product and component in
bugzilla for the backlog. Note some teams only work on one project. In this scenario having a single team with a single
project is OK.

***
## Managing Bugs

### Managing The Backlog
Any bugs with U C P tags will appear in the backlog. U C P tags denote User Component & Points and tell scrumbugs that
the bug has been vetted and should appear in the backlog.

### Managing The Ready List
When bugs can be worked on they should be moved from the backlog to the ready list. Bugs that are in the ready list
will appear on the aggregated ready list under the team.

### Assigning Work
Work is assigned under teams using sprints. You should create a sprint for whatever time period your team usually works
(2 weeks is common). As a 'team' you should move tasks from the ready list into a sprint making sure your devs have enough
to work on.

***
## Permissions
Only admins can create projects/teams and manage tasks. Non admins can view
sprints and team pages. If you need permission to do something please ask in #scrum or file a bug.

***
## When Do Bugs Update

Bug updates are pushed scrumbugs via email. This greatly simplyfies how we cache and update bug data.

Bug data is refreshed via bugmail every 30 seconds. Scrumbugz gets all bugmail and filters out only the ones
that matter using the Products/Components you specify in your project settings. These are then parsed and
the bugs are updated with what info we can get from the mail. The bug is then queued for a full refresh within
the next few minutes. Full backlog refreshes should no longer be necessary.

When you add a new Product/Component all open bugs with scrum data in the whiteboard will be pulled into
the system within a few minutes.

***
## Feedback Loop

If you encounter bugs or have suggestions, please file them in bugzilla under the scrumbugs component,
or reach out directly in #scrum.
