    <h1>Scrumify your Bugzilla</h1>
    <p>This site allows you to see all the scrummy details of the projects
    you're managing in Bugzilla. Just craft a search in Bugzilla that includes
    the bugs in your project, copy the url to that search result, and paste it
    into the "New Project" form. You'll then be able to manage sprints using
    this backlog for your project.</p>
